# Project: CARD

**Project: CARD** is a Unity Project which provides functionality to sort playing cards such as ***Shuffle, Straight, Same Kind***, and ***Smart*** in a very efficient way.

The project architecture is separated into three layers. The first layer is the **Core**, which contains the sorting algorithms and session management. The layer has been designed with ***pure C#***, and there isn't any Unity Engine library usage in the layer.

The second layer is the **Game** which contains the required gameplay implementation such as ***Level Management, Transition, Safe Area, TransformLayout, Managers, Asset Container***, and so on.

The last layer is the **Test** which contains unit tests with ***Unity Test Framework***.

### ðŸ›‘ Important! The project's entry point is MainScene.

### Optimization

The project also aims to achieve the **best possible optimization.** At this point;

```ðŸ‘‰ Used Sprite Atlas to reduce batch counts.```

```ðŸ‘‰ Used struct class as much as possible instead of class to use stack memory and avoid heap memory usage.```

```ðŸ‘‰ Less new and Instantiate keywords usages for object creation to avoid Garbage Collection.```

```ðŸ‘‰ Avoided complex nested algorithms and Linq usages for efficient CPU usage.```

```ðŸ‘‰ Avoided object re-instantiation and destroy, used the instantiated objects efficiently.```

```ðŸ‘‰ Used String Builder for string concatenations to avoid Garbage Collection.```

```ðŸ‘‡ MainScene Batch Count : 4 ðŸ‘‡```&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```
ðŸ‘‡ GameScene Batch Count : 5 ðŸ‘‡```
